write a test

one method get int

set it with shamuserdefaults
retreive it with nsuserdefaults
make sure the value is correct

set value iwth nsuserdefaults
retrieve it with shamuser defaults


rest of tests can be just making sure that set/get work backwards
 and nil tests


just do some command that mocks it and figure out the proper api later






figure out what ohhttpstubs and delorean do






any pods needed?
 swizzle
 testing

make subclass

when included swizzle


make cocoadocs
make travis ci thing



maybe something to do with synchronize?

might have to worry about syncronization
 I'm sure the main one is
look into that

make it a cocoapod

write documentation
